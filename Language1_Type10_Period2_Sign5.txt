Ruled by the number nine, this month is ideal for tying up loose ends and contemplating the future. Don’t make any important decisions now. Be content to weigh your options.

It’s possible old memories may be triggered, inviting you to forgive old resentments and release feelings of anger, hurt, and shame. </p>","Type":10,"Period":2,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"February 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
