Exercising compassion and forgiving past misdeeds will come naturally. You usually don’t suffer fools gladly. You’re happy to end relationships at the first sign of trouble. That won’t be the case now, when you’re feeling sentimental. Overlooking people’s faults and celebrating their best qualities will pave the way for happier and healthier friendships. You’ll also get a chance to resolve old grudges. If someone begs forgiveness, grant it freely and willingly. There’s no point in dwelling on the past when such a rewarding future beckons. </p>","Type":10,"Period":2,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"December 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
