However, where money and other resources are concerned, you're apt to be especially practical and efficient, so don't be surprised if you sail right through it and get it done well. Other paperwork, such as your own writing, should go equally well. Afterward, treat yourself to a nice dinner in your favorite restaurant!","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 17, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"d2216c41-fed1-4e85-8e54-46f20812e3bb","MainContent":"The astral influence will make quite a difference to your love life today.
