A friend or love partner might want to accompany you. The only problem might be figuring out what place you want to see the most. This could involve a rather difficult decision. Don't let it become obsessive. Follow your heart.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"d2216c41-fed1-4e85-8e54-46f20812e3bb","MainContent":"The planetary atmosphere may make partners seem rather argumentative right now. You may feel that yours is making rather a lot of fuss about nothing, and focusing on details that to you seem extraordinarily trivial and irrelevant. If you feel compelled to descend to the same level, you will only make matters a lot worse. It is best to keep a detached perspective and let this one blow over.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"833a1e0d-15fc-4066-b155-03c8c0bc2644","MainContent":"You are in the very beginning stages of an idea.

If you're enjoying this energy, then you probably have had some deep thoughts you will want to make a note of for future reference. If it's been a struggle, take confidence in the fact that many people are also feeling the impact of this intense emotional energy.
