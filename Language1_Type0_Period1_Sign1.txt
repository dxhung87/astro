Sleeping at the same time, eating at the same time, wearing the same style, and going about work the same way day after day. Before you know it, you feel like you're in a rut. The only way to get away from this is to make a decision to break free by doing something unique. Try a new haircut. Wear colors that are unusual for you. If the need is there, consider a new career. Pursue expansion.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 4, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"d2216c41-fed1-4e85-8e54-46f20812e3bb","MainContent":"Don't take it too personally if a loved one seems especially resistant to your charms.

Emotions and power are growling at one another; maybe they're even engaged in a real fight! The mental challenge is in stepping back and assess the situation. How much is at stake? Will it eventually blow over? Is it about winning and losing? Most of all, the challenge will be to continue to respect your personal health regimen in the face of this distraction.
