You could get at least one phone call of the \"good news, bad news\" variety, and this could have your moods swinging back and forth like a pendulum. Try to stay centered. Take the good news as encouragement, and as for the bad news, try to consider it objectively and figure out ways to turn it to your advantage. There's always a way.
