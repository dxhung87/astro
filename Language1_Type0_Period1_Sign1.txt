Yes, it's true that you have a considerable amount of work ahead of you, but surely you know that you can get it done. Trite as it may sound, making a list (no, you don't have to check it twice) will help you break the projects down into manageable chunks. It's so much easier to focus only on the next step rather than the entire Herculean task.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"61ca4457-b3d3-4150-aa9b-ef692c0acee4","MainContent":"Don't expect to get away lightly with a certain discussion that needs to be held today. The present astral energy means you need to keep up with all that a loved one is proposing. This is a wonderful chance to move to new levels within the relationship, but it does mean that you need to be open to anything and everything, rather than merely wanting what you want.\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"b8b4faba-6a7c-4f25-acaf-a9dbd4383f38","MainContent":"Someone may come down hard on you for changing your mind so many times today. Don't let him or her get you down. There is no reason to think less of yourself, or let someone think less of you just because you continue to modify your opinion.","Type":3,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"96a897d0-bc20-4e6e-b743-3f20be06c6a4","MainContent":"Today you get the feeling that rules are senseless. It's a bored feeling that needs to be re-integrated into the big beautiful circle called \"caring for yourself.\" To help brighten your day, and maybe take the doldrums out of the exercise routine or the dietary concerns, try to find something you need to just feel good today. New shampoo? Bubble bath? A special color in a scarf or shirt? A hot bath is definitely recommended - with drops of Jasmine or Pine essential oil.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
