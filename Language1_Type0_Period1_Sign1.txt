You might even spend the entire evening watching whatever happens to be on TV. It would be far more productive if you treated yourself to a trip to the bookstore and picked up some new reading material. At least you'll learn something while your partner is away!","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"61ca4457-b3d3-4150-aa9b-ef692c0acee4","MainContent":"Don't let the day end with bad feelings about someone who is particularly special to you. The current position of the planets may encourage a sense of conflict, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, unless you are always trying to avoid it. The disagreement that you have today may actually take your relationship to a more powerful level, if they are handled properly. Be kind to each other.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"b8b4faba-6a7c-4f25-acaf-a9dbd4383f38","MainContent":"You have the opportunity to make great strides in your work today by putting together different pieces of the puzzle.

If you remain open and loving toward yourself when you've made a poor choice, you will have the opportunity to learn what got you there. This is a good time to develop good diet and exercise habits. If you typically decide on your outfit a day in advance, or if you are good at planning the weekend's fun, try using the same type of planning toward the next day's diet and exercise!\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
