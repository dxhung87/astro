You'll be of great help to this person this way, but don't let your friend distract you from other things you need to do. You may have errands to run, people to see, tasks to take care of. Give your friend as much time as you feel is appropriate, then make your excuses.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"bb301fe3-c450-4dfa-9953-0e94b210e89a","MainContent":"The celestial influences may bring displays of drama.

As we are so committed to a better future for ourselves and our loved ones, there is a tendency to judge harshly. However, the burden of responsibility does not rest with you alone! Give yourself the freedom to take care of yourself first, not the whole world. Check in with yourself on a daily basis about your diet and exercise regimen.
