This may be career related or personal, but either way it should advance you in whatever direction that you want to go. The only downside is that you might be a bit too hard on yourself and far too critical of your work. Try to be objective and view your own work as fairly as you would view the work of others.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018"},{"ID":"724799f7-0bdf-4cf9-8c07-fc3a91019111","MainContent":"You prefer to show your love interest how you feel by demonstrating your affection through direct action, such as buying presents, giving them a massage, or taking them somewhere expensive.

But remember that nobody, ever, has it all figured out! Remember the adage, \"To err is human, to forgive divine.\" That doesn't just mean forgiving others - you must learn to appreciate your own ability to forgive yourself. Judgment will prevent you from listening to your own intuition. Your basic needs are to eat well, to get plenty of rest, and to exercise. Start with all three today!\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
