It's likely that some sort of local event has brought all your neighbors together under one roof. You go as an obligation, but stay out of interest and a genuine willingness to participate. There is nothing like rolling up one's sleeves and working together to tackle a common goal. Expect to make some good friends in the process.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 3, 2018"},{"ID":"724799f7-0bdf-4cf9-8c07-fc3a91019111","MainContent":"You are generally warmhearted and loyal to those who support your cause, but woe to those who criticize or dare to suggest that you are not equal to the sunshine itself!

If you choose to sail above the petty squabbling that occurs from time to time in your relationships, you will find it even more challenging to deal with this energy inside yourself. Do not ignore the tension that arises between your higher self and your human desires.
