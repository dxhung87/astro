When the phone rings, you might already know who's on the other end of the line before you pick it up. You could also pick up telepathically on the thoughts of others. Books and articles about people who have had similar experiences could increase your understanding of them. Don't fight it! Go with the flow.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"1fed9b50-0186-49dc-a38e-f058c0ee1ad2","MainContent":"You would benefit by taking some time today to negotiate issues that need resolving between you and your dearest one. It is no good talking at cross-purposes, or trying to bulldoze your way through to reach a specific outcome. You need to genuinely be able to listen, without becoming rude and arrogant, and then be able to speak honestly from the heart.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"26530fbb-61e0-4209-a038-c73e99d9ed86","MainContent":"Your dreamy, fanciful nature is useful, but only if it is coupled with concentration and focus.

Whatever can be improved upon, your soul is right on the scene. You finally want to start focusing more on your well-being. You are known for being focused on the greater good while sometimes egregiously ignoring the personal, the right here at home, the person looking at you in the mirror... Get where this is going? Stop saving the world and get yourself to the gym, and pay attention to what your body is trying to tell you.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
