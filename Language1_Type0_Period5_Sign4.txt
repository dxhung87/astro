If your job or home life leans toward the sedentary, your health can suffer if you don't engage in some physical activity. Not only is your body affected by a lack of exercise but your mind and emotional disposition can become depleted over time as well. Even a daily walk or playing a sport once a week can make a world of difference. Try something today.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21bdbf30-94bf-47b4-a2a3-f5303d066543","MainContent":"The celestial alignment may make you feel hopelessly in love. While this is certainly a delightful experience and one that you will no doubt be hopeful to have last as long as possible, you would also be advised to get a more balanced viewpoint of your condition, if love can be called such.

Get some exercise after work so that your body is truly ready for the depth of pampering you are about to subject it to. Have some light food on hand to enjoy while you spend the evening in you own private spa. Light candles, draw a hot bath. Magnolia oil would be the perfect touch for a physical and psychic cleansing.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
