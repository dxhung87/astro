While everyone else is busy buckling down and getting back to work, you should enjoy some leisure time. Take up a hobby, go on a few dates, play sports, and read for pleasure. Do your best to keep your schedule open and flexible. Be willing to meet friends on the spur of the moment even if it means abandoning a few annoying tasks.
