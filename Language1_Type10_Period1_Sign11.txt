There will always be work and serious things to take care of - but it doesn't always have to be by you. Nor do you have to offer constant service to others. You DO need to give to yourself once in a while, and on this 5-Day, there's no time like the present. Give it some thought. What would you really enjoy doing?

Enjoy yourself.</p>","Type":10,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 23, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
