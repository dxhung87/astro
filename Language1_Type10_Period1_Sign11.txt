This 7-Day will encourage this kind of time, as it brings rejuvenation to your mind and soul. Even if you have to put in a full day with family, there's always time for a walk. If possible, enjoy a hot bubble bath by candlelight, or lie back and listen to your favorite music. Or, meditate for a while and get some extra rest. You'll feel refreshed and ready to go afterwards.</p>","Type":10,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 25, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
