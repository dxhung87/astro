Thinking about things is good, Taurus, but overthinking just leads to wasted time and energy. Love goddess Venus spends time in creative Pisces on the tenth, which puts you in the mood for romance. The object of your affections is about to find out exactly what you have to offer, and he or she would be foolish to turn it down. A watery trine between the Pisces sun and the Cancer moon on February 25 can really bring out your emotions, and your sensitivity is off the charts. Not taking rejection personally is so much more easily said than done.\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":2,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"February 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"c1f38c3f-9cc5-4a65-9447-069bc2374ab1","MainContent":"A client, patient, or customer could demand more than you can give around February 3, marking a parting of ways.

With Saturn in this position, any stiffness or tiredness may be a more regular occurrence than usual. However, it’s important that you not stop exercising. Swimming can be excellent, because it means you’ll get a proper workout while exercising both muscles and joints, and it doesn’t subject them to unnecessary stress. With Jupiter in Scorpio, why not join a swim club with a friend and become a water baby?","Type":5,"Period":2,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"February 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
