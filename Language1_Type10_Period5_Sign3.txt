After having given so much energy to preparing for this holiday, you might need this outlet. Given that it is a 7-Day, this kind of introspection will come much more easily to you. It's a part of your life-path to express yourself, yet without taking regular personal inventory of where you're at in life, this powerful aspect of you can be stifled.

The work you do afterwards will show much more depth and personalization.</p>","Type":10,"Period":5,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 25, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
