Expect to hear some bizarre stories, some of them true, others that are clearly exaggerated. Out of all this friendly banter and tale telling, however, you could acquire some useful information. Make a note of it so you'll be able to remember it later.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 6, 2018"},{"ID":"5f74ef1b-c92d-46d6-8c68-1571e7b8fe47","MainContent":"You may find that a particular date you had been looking forward to for some time proves not to be the passionate encounter you had hoped it would be. The energy emanating from the planets encourages a positive flow of feelings, but this may show itself more in deep conversation rather than amorous embraces.

Instead of trying to do everything and as a result getting into a rut, keep your priorities at the top of your list throughout the day. Remember that you are of little use to others if your own needs have gone unmet. What do you really need to accomplish? Your health needs should be among your highest priorities: good fresh food that you eat slowly is a must!\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 6, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
