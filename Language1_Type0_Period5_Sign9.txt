Unusual expenses may have depleted your reserves, so you might have to cut a few corners. Your income, however, is probably the same if not slightly higher. This is, therefore, only a temporary situation, and your accounts should be back to normal in time, although some caution with regard to spending may need to be observed for a while. Work creatively on your budget and try to relax.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"5f74ef1b-c92d-46d6-8c68-1571e7b8fe47","MainContent":"You can play all kinds of games and drag red herrings all over the place in order to try and fool someone about your feelings.

Try to plan ahead: shop for dinner early and know what you want to prepare. Make yourself healthy renditions of your favorite \"comfort\" foods you loved as a child. Give into the urge to rest and nurture yourself, but in a healthy and conscious way. If you invite a friend to join you for dinner, ask them to take a walk with you afterward.
