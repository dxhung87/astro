This might involve writing, teaching, or speaking in some way. As a result of your zeal, your body could be exhausted but your mind spinning like a top, even though the thoughts coming up may be scattered. It might be best to pace yourself now more than you're inclined to.

This does not necessarily mean a \"stomach ache\"! It is more like a weakening of the will (i.e., your \"gut instinct\"). This aspect can present itself in a variety of ways: over-sleeping, over-eating, or \"forgetting\" to express your emotional truth to those with whom you're in relationship.
