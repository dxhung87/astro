Your mind is not as focused as it usually is, and it might temporarily be difficult for you to grasp new concepts that you've never encountered before. This is no reflection on your intelligence, just one of those vague days we all have. By tomorrow, all should be normal again.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"bb180371-6682-4974-af8f-f6c99afae44b","MainContent":"You will have to talk your way into gaining the attention of a certain person, the thought of whom keeps you awake at night. Not only that, you will have to convince them that you are seriously interested and deeply committed to their welfare, yet independent, ambitious, and able to fend for yourself. If this seems like a tall order, then you had better think again before plunging ahead into this new relationship.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"4c54bffd-1f30-4440-83b4-d4769a263e96","MainContent":"Join together with people who have a similar viewpoint to yours.

Your body is your temple, and it's a great couple of days for worship! Try to prepare your food as though you were a religious monk celebrating the deity of pleasure: fresh fruits (organic taste better), whole grains, and your favorite flavors. Your body is a sacred ornament: polish it within and without with exercise (yoga massages your internal organs) and exfoliating baths (oats and chopped pear is a great mixture to bring into the water and rub onto your skin).","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
