Stop sitting around waiting for someone else to make a decision. By the time the others are done arguing and vacillating about which direction to go, you will already have traveled miles and miles down the road. Your heart wants you to take a strong, independent stance.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"bb180371-6682-4974-af8f-f6c99afae44b","MainContent":"You know that you want to say something of real significance to deepen the bond between you and a loved one, but you are not sure which approach would be best.

Meaning, focus on your wellness before you try to benefit from giving a sense of \"well-being\" to others. It isn't easy, but is an important ability to cultivate. On any given day ask yourself what you've done for yourself: a nice refreshing run in the fresh air, particularly healthy meals and lots of water, a decision to have an early night for a good rest. These are the things that truly matter.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
