When you look at things relatively, rather than turn into a vague generalist, why not try coming up with a philosophy that's more constructive? What good is the ability to see all sides of an issue if you can't channel your insight and observations into something specific?","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 27, 2017"},{"ID":"5f74ef1b-c92d-46d6-8c68-1571e7b8fe47","MainContent":"As you naturally love to help others through times of difficulty, it could be while in this role that you make a connection that will develop special meaning and depth as time goes by. The astral alignment brings you close to another on a deeply intimate level, which at first may not be at all physical. However, the emotional satisfaction more than makes up for this.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 27, 2017"},{"ID":"8ed8c055-b839-46ff-9753-5893e263b2f6","MainContent":"Don't rely on your co-workers to pick up the broken pieces that you may have left behind over the past few days.

You may experience other people's feelings as obstacles, or somehow too much to deal with. Your own feelings may seem out of reach or overwhelming. Try to take some quiet time to center yourself and find your emotional core. Any element's hold on you is stronger when you are unaware of it, so try to pay attention to what you are feeling by getting some kind of exercise.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 27, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
