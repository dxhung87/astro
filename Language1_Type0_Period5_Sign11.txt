You may instead feel like delivering one of your famous stings, if anyone so much as dares to mention a particular person who is causing you quite a bit of angst. It may be better still if you keep to small talk, rather than attempting any deep stuff.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 21, 2017"},{"ID":"e817cf19-1822-4fc1-915f-039115011c9b","MainContent":"You are ready to move up in your current job but it seems that the people around you are holding you back in some way.

Try turning your soft underbelly towards the world instead of that hard shell and you'll be surprised at what happens. There is a tendency to get stuck in \"receiving\" mode, however, so don't forget your own needs. Use the energy to remind yourself of what you really want and don't be afraid to vocalize it. Take time out to go to the gym, for example, if you are a busy parent. It will help you to better help others.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 21, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
