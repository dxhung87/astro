Some equipment with which you work might suddenly go out of order and it could take a while to get it fixed. A temporary separation from a romantic partner could also be disappointing. You may have a lot of physical energy for which you have little immediate outlet. Take a long walk. This could not only provide an energy outlet but clear your head as well.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 25, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"e1d7d4a8-d9a2-4025-b2b6-b33fc15adaee","MainContent":"You tend to stick to difficult relationship situations for far longer than is actually necessary.

There are moments in life that we wish we could capture on film: the way you feel good after a healthy meal, the feeling of strength when you complete a great workout, the successful meeting of minds when you share your feelings with those closest to you.
