Most likely you'll want to be out and about, perhaps at a large gathering, perhaps just strolling down a city street watching the people go by. Insights and revelations come to you that you'll probably be able to make more sense of than you usually do, because mind and feelings are joined in a very effective partnership. Write your ideas down! Enjoy your day.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"e1d7d4a8-d9a2-4025-b2b6-b33fc15adaee","MainContent":"The planetary atmosphere is causing you to react defensively to a certain situation concerning an important relationship. You feel that you want to toss back as much as you have so far received, with a few more choice words thrown in on top for good measure.

Take, for example, your tendency to withdraw into yourself. You may respond to certain stresses by staying inside a lot, over-eating and closing down emotionally. Ask yourself: is that really what you need to be doing? Now, use the celestial energy to push yourself to get outside and get some exercise, knowing it is \"the right thing to do.\" And don't forget to share your feelings with friends!","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
