Perhaps your home or car requires some important repairs, or maybe some new equipment is necessary for your work. This could prove rather disheartening, as it might involve spending money that you'd rather use for something more exciting. Think of the trouble this expenditure should save you, however, and you'll see the value of it all.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 31, 2017"},{"ID":"5cab2baf-bafe-4a69-b1fd-f36a31e7343c","MainContent":"The current astral energy is making certain issues between you and your sugar honey rather unclear. Although you want to resolve these matters before they get out of hand and become way too complicated and abstract, right now this is not possible.

In order to take better care of yourself, take a close look at what you consume on a daily basis. It's important to keep weeding out the unhealthy habits, especially as you get older.
