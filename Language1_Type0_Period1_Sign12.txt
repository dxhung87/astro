Chances are good that you'll feel a renewed physical strength with energy to spare. That said, it might be a good day to tackle any projects that require you to use some muscle. Perhaps there's some yard work that needs to be done or furniture you want to move around. On the fun side, you might want to get to the gym for a workout or swim. Whatever the activity, today is a good day to go for it!","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 5, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3f93d2ee-6178-49b9-9472-babb36d24c4a","MainContent":"You really need to lift your eyes to the horizon and beyond, instead of keeping them firmly fixed on the ground and what is immediately in front of you.

This may \"work,\" but it does have a more abrupt side that upsets your health in subtle but serious ways. When you detach from others you detach from yourself. This sends ripple effects throughout your whole body. It tells your stomach its hungry even if it's not, it tells you to sleep instead of stay active, etc. Keeping an eye on yourself is key.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 5, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
