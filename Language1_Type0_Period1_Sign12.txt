The time has come to deal with some of the important questions you may have been avoiding for quite some time. It could be especially important to take a look at your life at home and see what you can do change the negative atmosphere that has come into your life over the past few weeks. Compromise can be a good thing, but not at the cost of your values and beliefs.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 19, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3f93d2ee-6178-49b9-9472-babb36d24c4a","MainContent":"You may decide to give up on love and relationships altogether, given the current planetary aspect. A certain person with whom you thought you had a special rapport proves very distant. Don't take this as a sign that the relationship is off. It is just that your partner (current or prospective) is going through a period of inner turmoil, and needs time to reflect on what is happening. Be patient and don't deter from the path you are on. Keep going!","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 19, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"ab5f5b02-411b-4024-a86c-01dd50425369","MainContent":"This is one of those days in which people may talk a great deal, but end up saying nothing.

Remember to slowly increase the amount of exercise you get, and to introduce new activities gently. Try to adjust your eating habits by making small changes - but make these changes! If you want to reduce dairy, for example, first give up certain forms that you won't really miss, like cheese on your sandwich. You will notice your awareness rising with every decision you make.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 19, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
