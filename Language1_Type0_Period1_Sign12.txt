Today is a day to reach out and touch someone, so pick up the phone and dial it. It's a good day to share your dreams with others, despite how farfetched they may sound. Others may look at you as if you have three heads, but as long as you're being honest with yourself, there's no reason for you to be shy about sharing.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"},{"ID":"75aa29f6-333e-430e-b89d-7331a360b253","MainContent":"Love and romance are delightful, but tend toward being more spiritual and platonic. The planetary energy encourages you to meet others from all walks of life, and this need not necessarily be in the flesh; it could also be on the Internet that you make some truly wonderful contacts.

The resistance to discipline can be quite strong. For instance, if you begin to think of all the things you could be doing to live a healthier life you could easily scare yourself. Try noticing what you already do that is working for you, then try to figure out what you really enjoy and what feels like a chore. Perhaps you can adjust, and put more in of the former and reduce the latter. See how it goes.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
