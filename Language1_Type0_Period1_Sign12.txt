You've been working very hard in order to advance yourself in this regard, and youâ€™re likely to continue to do so indefinitely. Your natural communication skills continue to serve you well, and your physical energy is likely to be stronger than it has been for a long time. The only downside is having very little time to yourself!

The ability to sense your emotions is increased today; however, you are also feeling ambivalent. There is a tendency to drop the practice when you don't get an answer quickly, but this would be foolish. If you went to yoga yesterday, great! Go again today.
