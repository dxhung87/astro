While it's true that some days can seem to drag on, the busier you are the faster time will pass. Get down to finishing any work still before you and then make plans for tonight. If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, not only will things seem to speed up but you'll feel better knowing it's coming.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 4, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3f93d2ee-6178-49b9-9472-babb36d24c4a","MainContent":"The astral energy may make you react in a far more obstinate way than you actually need to right now.

Are you ready to begin taking your diet more seriously? What you put in your mouth goes a long way toward shaping your life. Eventually, as you recently noticed, it has an effect on how you see yourself (in the mirror). Why not ask yourself up front how you want to see yourself? Examine your eating habits (when you are not hungry) and ask yourself: who do I want to be?","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 4, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
