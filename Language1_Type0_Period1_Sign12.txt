You could receive some surprising ideas from newspapers, TV, or the Internet. Your level of intuition is very high. No matter how outrageous an idea may seem, consider it carefully before making a decision. A written plan of action for anything you do would be helpful. Too many ideas are popping into your head and you'll want to keep track of them.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 31, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3f93d2ee-6178-49b9-9472-babb36d24c4a","MainContent":"The day's planetary energy brings a lighthearted approach to your personal relationships. If you have been going through a rather serious time with your partner (current or prospective), then arrange an evening out; break away and go somewhere special. Take in a show, or go see a humorous movie. Do anything to ensure you get a chance to laugh, even if it means being a little offbeat or outrageous for once.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 31, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"ab5f5b02-411b-4024-a86c-01dd50425369","MainContent":"Transformation is possible on a day like today. The energy is right for you to take a fresh new start on an old problem. Tackling old problems with old remedies is no longer going to work.

How easy or difficult is that for you to do these days? You tend to direct your energy outward: projecting your energy onto projects in the outside world or focusing on others. This is fine, but it's very important to be able to check in with yourself when you need to. A yoga practice gives you that opportunity, plus it's great for your muscle tone. Give it a try!","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 31, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
