Don't be afraid to be more ambitious than before, Leo, because you've acquired an inner power that gives you more confidence and a stronger belief in yourself. It is belief in our own self-worth that gives us the power to move mountains.

Sometimes it even throws you off! You have such basic needs, but yet you feel inexplicably lonely at times. To tune into those needs that aren't so grounded, try engaging in some kind of water therapy. Start by making your bathtub your shrine.
