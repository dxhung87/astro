In fact, you might be leaving pretty soon, and you're probably growing excited. Some surprising developments could come up during the course of this journey, and thus it's likely to shape up to be more than a simple vacation. Make sure you look your best, don't hold back on what you want to do, and have fun.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 6, 2018"},{"ID":"2ee68097-dfc7-46bd-8565-9d97c21e7ea4","MainContent":"You want passion, but will perhaps be a bit suspicious about the quality of romance served up today. The planetary alignment offers a chance to get to know someone more deeply, but for you there is still that all-important emotional harmony missing. The very obvious intellectual compatibility doesn't quite make up for this, either, at least not in your book.

Picture the little billy goat on the mountain, unsure of his next step! Others may say that you make a big deal out of nothing, but inside you feel anxious. Ignore them! But don't ignore your anxiety. Create a habit of doing things that release tension and calm your anxiety. A monthly massage, for instance. Schedule the time and keep it: it is a preventative measure, not a cure for symptoms!\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 6, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
