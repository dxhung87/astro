Your bulletin board is cluttered with invitations to lectures and parties, Leo, but your eyes begin to glaze over at the thought of attending all these events. Just how many chicken dinners is one expected to consume in a lifetime? It may be time for you to reassess your priorities. Rather than trying to say yes to everything in order to please everyone, why not start saying no in order to please yourself?\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 7, 2018"},{"ID":"2ee68097-dfc7-46bd-8565-9d97c21e7ea4","MainContent":"It may not be easy to convey to a certain special someone just how much you care about them.

Consider inviting some people you trust over for a home cooked meal and letting them in on your secret life! This will feel scary at first, but you will touch them with your openness, and the days and weeks to come will feel a bit warmer for the contact. While you're at it, cook something that \"expresses who you are.\"","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 7, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
