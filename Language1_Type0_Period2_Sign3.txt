Make a list of all the income streams and resources that you already have and be pleasantly surprised by what's been overlooked. On the sixteenth, the new moon connects you intimately with a lot of people who want to hear what you have to say. Some may ask favors. Be popular and professional and handle it all with ease. On January 31, a second full moon (and a lunar eclipse) could bring you support and help from a friend or neighbor. You won't need to ask, and it will be freely given. <br><br> Standout days: 10, 12, 31<br> Challenging days: 23, 24\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":2,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"January 2018"},{"ID":"074bdc99-a475-47eb-a3a6-20540610ab16","MainContent":"The full moon in your sign on December 3 is the time to resolve any communication issues with an ex. Wrap up any conversations about ongoing issues and agree to put them to bed forever. The combination of Venus (finances) and Neptune (confusion) isn’t great on the tenth, because you might have to finally pay attention to a money matter you’ve been doing your best to avoid. If you can’t find a viable solution, it could affect your long-term love life. When the sun enters practical Capricorn on December 21, you feel more committed and responsible than usual. Your realistic, sensible approach to romance is a welcome departure.\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":2,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"January 2018"},{"ID":"ec9ff5a2-b52d-481d-9a01-88e972e314a6","MainContent":"On January 1, money for a job well done could arrive when a generous full moon lights up your second house of income.
