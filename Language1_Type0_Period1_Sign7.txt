You could pay visits to a few people nearby, Libra, or spend a lot of time on the phone trying to learn the truth.

Remember that your reflective nature tends to give a lot of credit to others while at the same time depriving yourself of the same. Break this pattern of find yourself in a rut, comparing yourself to others or worse, manipulating others to balance the insecurity you feel.
