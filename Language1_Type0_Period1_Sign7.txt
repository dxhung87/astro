You're one of best people to give them the support and care they need. Just be sure that you don't give so much to others that you don't have anything left for yourself. True friendship is about sharing and the exchange of problems and help. Running yourself down will leave you in a place where you arenâ€™t going to be much help to anyone.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 4, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"197dd1e6-6faa-4f84-bc60-12deed706b23","MainContent":"If someone gives you a special gift today, you may be at a loss as to how to react.

The group spirit is uplifting for your nature, which has a tendency to be introverted when left alone. And, having a goal can help shape your perspective about life, which can otherwise become obtuse and slightly pessimistic if you aren't careful. Enjoy yourself with friends who are physically active and see what energy comes of it.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 4, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
