If you have something that you know you and your partner (current or prospective) need to talk about, but aren't quite sure how to go about it, then your intuition may be telling you that it is better to forget it altogether. But if you can get the right perspective, this could make a great deal of difference.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 5, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"2f194a3b-3bf2-4446-aac9-f008d1b865a8","MainContent":"Other people may insist that you need to slow down, but you don't necessarily have to listen.
