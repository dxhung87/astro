This can be a result of the day's planetary influences, and if used well, this mood can prove most beneficial. It can add seriousness to your day that suits such activities as goal setting, budget planning, or recovery. Make the most of this energy by digging into the areas of your life that could use some rethinking.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"197dd1e6-6faa-4f84-bc60-12deed706b23","MainContent":"Moving in new circles is highlighted today.

Have whatever you feel like for breakfast - some toast and fruit - but stay away from caffeine of any kind. For the rest of the day, consume only fruit juice or vegetable broth. With a little preparation this can be an easy and refreshing experience.
