It could be that you aren't feeling a very strong connection with the environment around you. You could be anxious to spread your wings and explore your freedom. Start small but think big. Get out of your rut and do more exploring on your own. Thereâ€™s a sobering, disciplined feeling to the day that could help you think realistically about your situation and where you want to go with it.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"197dd1e6-6faa-4f84-bc60-12deed706b23","MainContent":"Things could get too passionate even for you today.

What does expanding your horizons mean to you? It might be time to find out - or, if you know what gives you a boost, go ahead and ask for it!
