This is one of those days in which emotional outbursts could explode in your face as a result of other people's reactions to your pressure. Don't feel like you need to take on the responsibility of everyone else's actions. You may be having a hard enough time dealing with your own personal issues.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 24, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21113cf9-d63b-49e5-af58-a3983c1da362","MainContent":"The celestial configuration is helping you understand that you can't always have it the way you want.

Fish oil has tremendously beneficial effects on the nails and hair, and doesn't tax the digestive system as red meat does. Enjoy the lighter things in life: fresh vegetables, bean curd, soy products and herbal tea. Even if you make substitutes only once a week, you will benefit in the long run from your effort.
