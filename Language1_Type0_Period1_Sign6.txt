Instead of getting upset and frustrated by the fact that you aren't getting what you want, look for the lesson in the situation and the reason why you really don't need those things at all. Things with extremely high sentimental value may seem very important to you right now, but maybe there is an important reason why you need to let go and move on from that particular sentiment.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 29, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21113cf9-d63b-49e5-af58-a3983c1da362","MainContent":"The celestial alignment makes this a very reassuring time in terms of your personal relationships.

However, do not begin to neglect the regimented program you have been trying to follow regarding diet and exercise. Now more than ever it is important to keep the internal pathways open - physically and energetically. At least three times a week you must exercise your body to let fresh energy bubble forth and old energy recycle on through the universe.
