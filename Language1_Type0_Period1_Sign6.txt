Pictures, crafts, cookies, candies, or books can make a wonderful package to send to someone special. Even a simple greeting card can really brighten someone's day. Have some fun.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21113cf9-d63b-49e5-af58-a3983c1da362","MainContent":"This is a very good time to show your partner (current or prospective) just how much care for them in a particularly tender way. You can give them the works, like a wonderful candlelit bubble bath, accompanied by white peaches in brandy.

The stakes are even higher when it comes to your health. The energy it takes to eat well and exercise often is infinitely less than the energy it takes to deal with illness. Take a moment to steer yourself in the right direction if tense, stressful times have put you off your usual health regimen.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
