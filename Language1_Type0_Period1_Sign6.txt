Some of them may appear to be trustworthy and some may not. Today, however, your instincts are highly attuned and you'll be better than usual at sizing up people you don't really know. Make the most of this ability, and don't let logic get in its way. Follow your heart!","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21113cf9-d63b-49e5-af58-a3983c1da362","MainContent":"The boundaries between you and another may be very unclear today.

A clear pathway is open to you so ask yourself: what do you want for your health? Do you want to ignore your body until invasive medical measures are required? Or do you want to have an informed, delightful experience of nurturing your body and your mind in a preventative fashion? If you prefer the latter, maybe it's time to invest in your choice of text: a healthy cookbook, a holistic hygiene reference, or a book on feng shui.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
