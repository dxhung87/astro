Most likely, the people who criticize you the most are the ones who understand you the least. They are probably on a completely different wavelength than you, and it isn't your job to try to change them, nor is it your responsibility to change your ways because of them.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21113cf9-d63b-49e5-af58-a3983c1da362","MainContent":"If you can place a certain grievance in context and trace back the source of the aggravation right down to its beginnings within you, then you will have done both yourself and a loved one a favor.

Nurture your natural vision with sources of Vitamin A and Beta-carotene. Do not rub your eyes if they are tired or itchy. There are better ways to find relief. Use delicate eye moisturizer for the skin around the eyes. Wear sunglasses to prevent sun damage (yes, especially when the glare is strong). Your vision is a gift - use it to see, and do, good in the world.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
