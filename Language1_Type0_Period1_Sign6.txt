Don't keep these feelings inside or they'll eat away at you, Virgo. Take advantage of your day today to put all your cards on the table and forget about revenge, because it could just turn against you. Instead, why don't you try to reach out to that person and explain your feelings to him or her? The good energy you get from this experience could be very beneficial to you tomorrow.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 20, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21113cf9-d63b-49e5-af58-a3983c1da362","MainContent":"Love will thrive when you woo your beloved with sweet and desirable presents, which will encourage them to move even closer to you.

No, I am not talking about turning back the clock! Give yourself the time between activities to re-group and understand what you want and need to do next. When we rush from place to place, we lose our sense of purpose and regret the time we waste. Even the choice of what you eat will be affected by giving yourself enough time to notice what you really want.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 20, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
