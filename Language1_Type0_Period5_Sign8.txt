Maybe the present is costly or not something you really like. You might also feel that your friend is too eager. What you do in this situation is, of course, up to you. Tip: don't refuse the gift unless you genuinely feel itâ€™s totally inappropriate. And definitely don't give it back because that's what your mother would do!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 3, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3be9c18b-9f56-42bf-b62b-9b9cb6ae7dbc","MainContent":"The astral energy may make you a little more careful about making any plans for the future concerning you and your partner (current or prospective).

This might have something to do with a tense period you're going through, where things tend to get a little bottlenecked. Keep all channels open with plenty of water and fresh vegetables and at least a few yoga classes or whatever exercise releases your tension the best. Try to do this whenever you are subjected to a lot of stress, rather than putting it off until afterwards.
