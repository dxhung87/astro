Today is a day to forge ahead with ideas and dreams rather than commitments and answers. Question things and debate the facts. Whatever you do, have fun. This is the perfect day to go out and enjoy the fresh air with an outdoor activity, especially group activities. You can't go wrong with joining up with friends and chatting away about the latest events of your life.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"},{"ID":"571c0760-9f76-403e-8bb9-4aed08407150","MainContent":"The astral aspect at play creates a great atmosphere, as long as you can be realistic about your relationships.

Honor your impatience with appropriate measures. Give yourself extra time to get to your appointments, and don't set yourself up for frustrating situations. When it comes to eating, choose what you put into your body carefully. Be sure you like what you order or prepare; otherwise, you will not be relaxed and truly fulfilled by your meal.
