The drive to exercise, particularly if you do it alone and outdoors, is likely to get the endorphins going and thus give you a natural high, which could lead to an increased level of inspiration and intuition. After you finish, it might be a good idea to sit in a park, preferably near water, to allow yourself to come down. Meditate and take a close look at your inner state.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"52534fe3-01bd-432e-9e6e-3d473ae2b244","MainContent":"Even though you are usually very flexible and adaptable in your relationships, and usually willing to compromise in order to keep things on an even keel, the tables may turn today.

A river's path is not altered without a few battles between substances! This is a natural process: let the part of you that does not want to change a habit or the part of you that doesn't want to open up and be exposed have its say, full and complete. Then ask yourself: who is boss?
