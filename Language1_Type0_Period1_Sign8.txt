They might involve outings, perhaps to parks or other recreational areas. You'll enjoy it, but your mind may be on other matters, possibly projects you're involved with. Some stimulating conversations with someone close to you could take place. By day's end, your mind could be going a thousand miles an hour. Be sure to get a little exercise so you can sleep.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 21, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"52534fe3-01bd-432e-9e6e-3d473ae2b244","MainContent":"The astral alignment encourages you to bring a little more depth to your romantic conversation today, as this will help you break through a barrier that could be causing delays. All you really need to do is speak from the heart and the rest will take care of itself.

The planetary energies working together are reminiscent of the effects of the combos: diet and exercise, rest and action, time alone and time shared with others. In each coupling, there is the preparation aspect and the realization aspect. Bringing this kind of balance into your life takes commitment - it does not happen by chance. Meditate (whatever that means to you), and focus.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 21, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
