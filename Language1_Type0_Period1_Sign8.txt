Seize the energy that flows from today's planetary aspects, make a list of things that need to be decided in the areas of work, relationships, and finances, and go down the list one by one. Don't be afraid of making a mistake. Better that than missing out entirely, don't you think?","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"52534fe3-01bd-432e-9e6e-3d473ae2b244","MainContent":"The celestial alignment may encourage you to think of some more imaginative ways to spend time with your partner (current or prospective) than the ones you normally employ. Rather than worrying whether they will think you are some kind of freak, just be open and honest, and say you would like to do such and such, or go to this certain place.

This involves planning ahead. Have an idea of what sort of workout you are going to enjoy each day, plan at least three meals that you prepare at home (with leftovers for lunch the next day!) and give yourself a general hour by which to be ready for bed. This kind of planning will stand you in good stead as you try to settle your body's energy during busy times.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
