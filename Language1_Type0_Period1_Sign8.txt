Perhaps it might be best to busy yourself with routine tasks you can do automatically and, if you can, put off the more creative endeavors until your brain gets back in gear. Don't be too proud or too shy to ask for help.

There is an escapist yearning in the air, causing behavior to become associated with food and laziness. If you're going to sit home and watch a movie tonight, try to make small concessions: soy based ice-cream, popcorn with yeast flavoring instead of butter, fresh lemonade instead of soda pop!","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":8,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
