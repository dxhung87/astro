Therefore, you could well decide to clean out the basement or tear all the weeds out of the backyard. Take care to pace yourself! These things need to be done, but not all at once. It's just as important for you to enjoy yourself as to spend the whole day working.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 18, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"81585e0b-46d5-4253-b53a-82c26b9e71dc","MainContent":"The planetary energy encourages one particular romantic liaison to become more prominent.

The current planetary configuration is like having Arnold Schwarzeneger and Michael Jordan on the same team! Raw strength and bright intelligence join forces. You may use this power to improve what you know to be your weak spot. If this has something to do with food, try shopping for meals in advance instead of eating out this week.
