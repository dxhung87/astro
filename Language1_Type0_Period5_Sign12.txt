There's a feeling of discipline that's helping you stay focused. Emotions are stifled, which may work to your advantage. Keep everything limited to the facts at hand, and work can proceed much more efficiently than if simple issues become big soap operas.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 28, 2017"},{"ID":"735549d6-bfda-413b-a0f8-5d31a082a57f","MainContent":"The astral alignment makes both you and your love interest very inclined to fantasize heavily today.
