And it's quite likely that it will be someone who really needs some comfort and support. Whether you have a huge list of things you want to get done or you were planning on just taking it easy, don't turn your friend away. Chores and hobbies will wait patiently for you, but lending care and support to someone in need often won't. Open your door and your heart if the situation arises.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"81585e0b-46d5-4253-b53a-82c26b9e71dc","MainContent":"The astral energy illuminates everything with a golden glow, and brings a touch of magic to your relationships.
