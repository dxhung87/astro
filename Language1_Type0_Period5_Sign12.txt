It might be information of such a bizarre nature that you find it difficult to accept, yet your source could be more than reliable. Conversations with others might seem vague and uncertain, as those around you aren't really feeling all that communicative. You might have to rely on intuition to discern how they're feeling.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"81585e0b-46d5-4253-b53a-82c26b9e71dc","MainContent":"The planets are really just a reminder that for every peak there is a trough, that nothing can continue along on the same even keel.

With so much attention being paid to your energetic personality, it can sometimes be a challenge to make yourself vulnerable and really know what you are feeling. Movement that challenges you to be physically vulnerable is a recommended practice for emotional release. Yoga, of course, and stretching out the chest cavity in particular. Applying a hot water bottle to your chest at night is another way to bring gentle attention to your emotional core.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
