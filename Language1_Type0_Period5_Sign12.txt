Intellect and intuition join together in a vivid and explosive union where the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts. Don't waste this energy. Get busy and work on whatever creative projects you're involved with, or start one if there aren't any. This energy may not come around again for a while and you'll want to make the most of it. Have fun!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"81585e0b-46d5-4253-b53a-82c26b9e71dc","MainContent":"Don't try and force your hand in a certain situation, especially given the planetary atmosphere. The relationship that you are trying to make work would actually work a lot better if you could just stop fretting and worrying quite so much. Sometimes too much involvement actually complicates things unnecessarily. You would be far better off to just allow things to develop naturally.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"8ed89daf-b6af-46be-a005-e3ce144d6f7d","MainContent":"More than one person might tell you how to do your job today. Listen with only one ear. Most likely, this person doesn't know much about anything you are involved with - so don't let him or her have too much of an influence on your day.

This feeling will follow you around for a couple of weeks, so you might as well roll up your sleeves and get into it! Your skin may reflect any stress you are feeling these days. Apart from really trying to get enough sleep and fresh air there are other things you can do to help ease the tension. If you shave or apply moisturizer to your face, add a drop of lavender oil to the soap or cream to calm your skin.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 26, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
