Both may want to recruit you to their side, but you'll want to avoid allying yourself with either party. The best you can do is mediate by trying to get each of them to see the other's point of view. Whether you succeed or not, you'll have tried your best.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"735549d6-bfda-413b-a0f8-5d31a082a57f","MainContent":"The current planetary alignment may make you wish that you had perhaps never set eyes on a certain person.

Try thinking about how you like to look, and the preparation that's involved there. You might spend an hour a day on making yourself look good.
