Perhaps you made a promise to handle a project, or someone close to you has decided that it's the day to tackle something specific. Either way, if you're uncomfortable following through, communicate that to this person. Your ability to express yourself and be understood is enhanced with this day's energy. Rescheduling might be far better than any potential resentment.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 6, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"81585e0b-46d5-4253-b53a-82c26b9e71dc","MainContent":"You are generally far too aware of the waste of time and energy that goes into petty disagreements.

You love drama. When there is no drama you can get anxious. This anxiety can create its own kind of negative drama, so it's better to let your energy out through some kind of physical activity. If you already follow an exercise regimen you may experience the rejection of simplicity in wanting to skip your daily workout.
