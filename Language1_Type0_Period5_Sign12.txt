Do you have a realistic budget, or does yours exclude such things as entertainment, gifts, and occasional splurges? Such a budget won't suffice, because these are expenses that everyone has. Take a good look at your spending habits and see where you could cut back without too much pain.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"81585e0b-46d5-4253-b53a-82c26b9e71dc","MainContent":"Don't hold back unnecessarily today. A loved one knows how you feel about them deep down, but would love to hear you say those words, which mean so much to them. Accompany this with a thoughtful gift, and perhaps a romantic meal for two, and you will have made them truly happy.

Communication of all kinds appeals to you: spoken, visual, artistic and physical. To know what you are really feeling, it's helpful to get some regular physical exercise that allows your body to \"speak\" to you. Once you know what you feel, you are more able to communicate to those people you really care about. Exercise is good for the body and the soul.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":12,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
