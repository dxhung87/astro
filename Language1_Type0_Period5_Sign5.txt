Stay close to home and all should be well.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"60dccce0-6068-49b7-810d-2472491d1d65","MainContent":"If you are searching for that perfect romance, don't go rushing into anything.

Try devising a quiz that you can give yourself a few times a month: call it, \"The Creature Comfort Quiz.\" The questions are up to you - but here are some examples: Is there enough bubble bath in the house? Do I have clothes that flatter my body type or do I need to do a little shopping for basics? Do I have my favorite fresh fruit in the house? Etcetera!
