Remember, however, that there are other people who share the world with you, so don't disregard them as you plow though the day. Expressing your thoughts should be no problem, but expressing your emotions could be a whole different matter. Don't push it if it doesn't feel right to share them with others at this time.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 24, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"60dccce0-6068-49b7-810d-2472491d1d65","MainContent":"You are by nature a creature of the ocean, and very much attuned to its tides and rhythms.

Try to alleviate this feeling by reaching out to others. Now, you do not have to walk up to people and say, \"Appreciate me!\" This is far from being your style. However, you do need to start getting out more. Even if it's just for an hour, get yourself into more social situations (which won't be too hard during the coming months). Talk about what you are doing and let people know your thoughts and feelings.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 24, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
