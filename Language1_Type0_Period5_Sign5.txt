For that matter, no one is. On the other hand, you surely have capacities that you've exploited in the past but now you seem persuaded that they're of no interest. It's time to rethink this issue.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 27, 2017"},{"ID":"a8b80cb5-3566-4af9-b7e9-d27166a10c11","MainContent":"Love and romance take on a deeply meaningful and philosophical air. The astral alignment encourages the highest and the best that you can muster from within yourself in terms of your current relationship, or any that you are considering entering into.

It may be a good time to clean up your act.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 27, 2017"},{"ID":"f6c20d69-8ef1-4729-b51e-1bd0d4aee697","MainContent":"If something comes across your desk today that you don't understand, ask someone for advice.

There may have been many days like this in your life. You seem to know your intentions, but the impact of your words and actions can leave people feeling confused, and sometimes afraid of you. The key is to recognize your own intensity and nurture it with things you do solo: skydiving or other risk taking activities being prime examples. Get your daily dose of exercise.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 27, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
