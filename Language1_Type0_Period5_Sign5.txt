Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little if anything to do with you, Leo, or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of their way until they're over it! This isn't a good day to give or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until tomorrow!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 28, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"60dccce0-6068-49b7-810d-2472491d1d65","MainContent":"You somehow find the way to express how you feel to a certain person who has recently made quite a difference to your life.

Of course this doesn't mean no exercise or giving up on your healthy sleeping schedule! That would be counter-productive. You feel at ease with your conscience, so enjoy your long runs and the sensation of peacefulness that you feel when you spend time alone. Your nature is quite spiritual, and exercise feeds your spirit.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":5,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 28, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
