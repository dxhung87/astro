The moon conjoins Mars in fiery Sagittarius on the eighth. Connect with a large number of people and come out on top. The new moon (and solar eclipse) on February 15 is packed with people and social interaction. Meet some new people and let them show you some new and exciting places and events.

Heart usually wins over head, but being too emotional could steer you wrong. The Mars-Neptune square on the seventeenth makes your dating life the target of gossip and rumors, and the more you protest the more people love to talk. Luckily, you don’t really care what other people think. You don’t always know the right thing to say during the Mercury-Neptune conjunction on February 25, but neither does anyone else. Your confident actions make up for your lack of verbal finesse.\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":2,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"February 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3da9096f-4848-4e61-8c6d-d6deddbc4a71","MainContent":"A creative breakthrough could occur when you work with a group of innovative people on February 6.

The solar eclipse on February 15 could find you being named head of an important division. You’ll enjoy the challenge this role affords.

Be prepared to raise the ceiling on your fitness level, though, as you could do more than you think you can. On February 17, feisty Mars angles toward ethereal Neptune, so this could be a time when you feel fatigued or run down. Focus on eating plenty of protein and foods whose nutrients release slowly, as sugar won’t help you at this time. A solar eclipse on the fifteenth can be excellent for joining a fitness club and working out with friends. It could have very positive consequences for you.\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":2,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"February 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
