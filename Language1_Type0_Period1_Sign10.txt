Modern equipment of some kind might be involved. Don't make yourself crazy; this is only temporary and will be straightened out. Your own determination, efficiency, and practical abilities should have it taken care of in no time. Basically, you're probably feeling quite optimistic for the future and not likely to change that energy any time soon.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 25, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"1b75e988-f8fc-44e0-8710-73c42fc3a94e","MainContent":"The celestial configuration is helping you to accept love at a more realistic level.

One the one hand you thrive on perspective, and on the other you tend to focus on one goal at a time. Use the current celestial energy to build a healthy structure in your life. Take yoga, for example: go out and get yourself a mat, water bottle, etc. Organize your time so that you can try a few classes until you find the studio you want to use. Use the perspective and determination you gain to make progress.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 25, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
