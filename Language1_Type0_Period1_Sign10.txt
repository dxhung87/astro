An opportunity to earn a sizable fee doing something artistic could come your way. Spiritual or metaphysical studies may be involved. This might represent the attainment of a long-term goal you've been striving to reach, and therefore you're apt to be rather excited about it. Tonight, go out and celebrate your success with your friends.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"1b75e988-f8fc-44e0-8710-73c42fc3a94e","MainContent":"Your partner (current or prospective) is in a wonderfully sociable mood and will be only too pleased to take you out.

Activities such as running, swimming and yoga will strengthen your lungs and enhance the mercurial juices that are your lifeblood. Giving yourself what you need can become a matter of debate if you allow your diet and exercise regimens to go unscheduled. Your mind will strike up a discussion with your \"evil twin\" about what you really need - it can sound like this: \"Chocolate cookies? Running? Chocolate cookies? Running?\" Make a schedule and stick to it.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
