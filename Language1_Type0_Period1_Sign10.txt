There might be a number of options open to you, all workable, and this could prove confusing. If all options are efficient and practical, don't agonize over your decision. Flip a coin if you have to! Success is strongly indicated if you don't stress yourself out in the process.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"1b75e988-f8fc-44e0-8710-73c42fc3a94e","MainContent":"You may be tempted to give up the whole notion of relationships altogether, with today's astral energy at play. A loved one could appear to be totally lacking in any kind of warmth and spontaneity, and you may be tempted to wonder if they are actually still living. Take heart, this is just a temporary phase. Before you know it, you will both be in love again.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"ec5d9333-0d80-4a38-9c1e-d5c19cac48b9","MainContent":"Just because something is labeled \"work\" doesn't mean that it has to be tedious or boring.

With today's planetary energy, you are apt to succumb to sensual impulses that aren't always in your best interests: staying up late eating ice cream is one way to conjure up what I'm talking about! The cosmic climate adds to the dreamy lack of boundaries that is at once seductive and also trouble inducing. Enjoy yourself, but don't give up on your commitments - if you can still make it to the gym three times a week you're not a total goner!","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
