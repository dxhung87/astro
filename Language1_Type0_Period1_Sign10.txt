There probably isn't any concrete reason. It's likely that you're simply responding to low biorhythms. This is, therefore, a great day to go for a workout. This way you can get the endorphins going and feel a lot better by late afternoon. Then you should actually feel like going out and having some fun.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 5, 2018"},{"ID":"b406f802-94ac-473c-a479-b1d935aedf5f","MainContent":"You may feel like going either of two ways today. You can completely abandon yourself to the plans and goals that you and your beloved have decided to work on together, or you can start to pull it all apart through worrying and over-analyzing the details. Neither approach is very realistic or practical. If you are both going to make progress, you need to be adventurous in a circumspect way.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 5, 2018"},{"ID":"05c63102-f2e7-4b11-91de-51c3b4953ac1","MainContent":"Situations in your workplace may be going extremely smoothly, but don't get caught into thinking that things will always be flowing this well for you.

When you become more aware of what you need in your life, and you clearly go for it, you find clarity. Resistance, however, leads to confusion. When you feel confused, respect yourself and the process of working through it by staying with the confusion until you have experienced some sort of shift. Your own practice of either meditation or light exercise will be your guide. Talk rarely accomplishes anything; being with yourself more consciously is what's required.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 5, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
