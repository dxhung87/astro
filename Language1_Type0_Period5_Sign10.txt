You may be overwhelmed and need to \"come down\" to a more stable and comfortable place within yourself. Take ten minutes at home in the morning and ten minutes at night to do some deep breathing and stretching on the floor, and you will feel immediate effects. Calming yourself down may take a day or two, but you will feel more self-confident as a result.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
