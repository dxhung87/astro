Don't try to push yourself too hard to understand them today; you'll only confuse yourself that much more. You're not losing it; your mental biorhythms are simply low. Instead, look at something else for a while, and let the information churn around in your subconscious. It may hit you tomorrow and you'll want to cry, \"Eureka!\" Be patient with yourself.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"c03609e0-34e5-4ea9-9c58-6c61e96ce364","MainContent":"There are not a lot of ways you can go awry today.

If you set the stage properly, this brief transit will allow you to see more clearly into your mind. Set the stage with yoga, rest, exercise and a mindful diet. Allow yourself to know what you've been avoiding - ask for awareness so that you can progress along your personal path. It's important to eschew all inner judgment.
