Therefore, you could be tempted to go crazy buying decorative items. This is fine up to a point, but be careful! Some of the stuff that looks good in the store might not look quite the same once you get it home. Your guest is more interested in seeing you.

Start by getting rid of the clutter in your life. Clean out your closet, your kitchen cupboards, your bathroom cabinet. Get rid of all the excess baggage you're carrying around. This applies to your mental and physical selves, as well. You need to feel \"free\" - whatever that means to you.
