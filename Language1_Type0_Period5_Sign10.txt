It might seem as if others are trying to show you up today with their knowledge about the world and how it should be run. Don't let them talk you into believing that your thoughts and ideas are any less valid than theirs. At the same time, it's important for you to stay open-minded and accepting of other people's ideas.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"bef54012-4250-494c-853e-8b0c5bbbe9bc","MainContent":"The day's significant planetary aspect is giving you a choice. You and your partner (current or prospective) could go either of two ways, and so feel the need for some form of discussion. However, in this instance any dialogue may get you into even deeper trouble and will not actually help, as neither of you are totally clear on what you want.

Days of rest are extremely important, to be sure, but ask yourself whether you're just bored of the usual and want something new. This is not the same as your body asking for a day of rest: it's your mind wanting a new activity! Begin to develop variety in your workout routine so that you may respond to this impulse with compassion and discipline - a very healthy combination!","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
