This might involve a colleague or possibly someone in a group with which you're affiliated. It might even be someone you've never before considered as more than a friend. Whoever it is may seem to be too perfect to be true. Bear in mind that this is the first rush of infatuation, and that for romance to be successful you have to love a person's flaws as well.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 30, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"bef54012-4250-494c-853e-8b0c5bbbe9bc","MainContent":"The celestial alignment may help to give you a more grounded feeling, which could be very necessary right now.

To make this happen more often, take extra care at bedtime. Floss and brush your teeth, take care to have enough water during dinner so that you digest your meal properly during the night, and try to do some simple stretching before bedtime so that your body is more deeply relaxed as it rests.
