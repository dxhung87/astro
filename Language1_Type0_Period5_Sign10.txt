But take care that you don't implement change merely for the sake of change. Think carefully about what you really want to do. Some introspection just might reveal that the changes you seek are minor rather than major. You may simply want to begin working on your health a bit more. Jogging a few days a week and vowing to eat salads at lunch rather than sandwiches may bring about a wonderful ripple effect of health and well-being in your life.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":10,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 2, 2018"},{"ID":"2424bfca-f0f0-4f5e-aa4f-196377219afc","MainContent":"One problem that love interests involved in a relationship with you have is that after a certain time, your initial urge to supply them useful bits of philosophical or metaphysical knowledge begins to degenerate into what can only be described as continuous lecturing, even torturous nagging.

You will benefit tremendously from a regular yoga practice, running, or gym workout. Exercise can be almost a religious practice for some, for it relieves the nervousness and anxiety that plague everyday living. Finding a reason for the health regimen you keep is a good idea.
