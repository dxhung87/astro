You're in the process of abandoning the burden of always doing your \"duty.\" Miracle of miracles, you'll finally realize that you can't work all the time!

If you have felt at all overlooked, and wondered whether there was truly any future for you both, today's events should put your mind at rest. Although it may not be possible for your partner (current or prospective) to shower you with love continuously, you'll now know for certain how they feel.\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 22, 2017"},{"ID":"bbd60c2e-08a1-481a-b9b3-b452f5afa20e","MainContent":"A burst of positive energy is available to you and has a positive influence on your work.

Just don't let it drive you crazy! The urge to fix things, and even people, can lead you down a path of frustration. Take the time and do some kind of exercise that creates a meditative state. Repetitive exercise such as that of a structured yoga class or a series of laps on a track can give you the distance that you need. You will feel more at peace with yourself, too.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 22, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
