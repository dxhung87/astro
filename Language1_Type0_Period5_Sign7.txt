You'll probably spend a lot of time together, and during the course of the day your friend could jump between enthusiasm and gloom. This could drive you crazy, as you won't know how to respond. All you can do is make sure all attention stays focused on the issues at hand. This changeability should burn out by the end of the day.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 5, 2018"},{"ID":"bb819d89-fd19-486b-aac9-ca7cc8de1100","MainContent":"If you are wondering why you never seem to attract the kind of love interests that you want, perhaps you are looking for an ideal that doesn't exist.
