Thus, you are shifting away from the concepts that you've always accepted toward other ideas that you may have just learned. This could lead to projects of your own, perhaps involving writing or speaking. Open and honest communication with a lover might lead to an intimate evening together. Expect some intense conversation, among other things!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 15, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21b5d6c8-f751-4b87-93a5-bee08dd3ead6","MainContent":"The planets are causing you to feel it is not worth the effort to try and find a romantic partner.

To help strengthen your metaphysical talents, try creating a bedtime ritual that you follow religiously for two weeks. Whatever strikes you as appropriate: music, a hot bath, rhythmic dancing, stretching, singing lullabies to yourself, anything. Try to make your sleep ritual the apex of every 24-hour period.
