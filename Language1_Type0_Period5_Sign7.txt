Pull out your favorite craft supplies and have some fun exploring color and design. If you have children, consider including them in the activities. It may amaze you to listen to the incredible ideas and innovative thoughts your own kids have that youâ€™ve never thought of. If you don't have an \"idea box\" where old bottles, nuts and bolts, odd buttons, ribbons, and scraps of material can collect for times like this, start one today!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"21b5d6c8-f751-4b87-93a5-bee08dd3ead6","MainContent":"Be sensitive and open to the needs of your partner (current or prospective).

Expressing this energy to your loved ones is at the same time an opportunity to address yourself in the most loving way possible. If you have needs that you rarely express to those you love, take advantage of this time to get your own needs across in a playful or friendly way.
