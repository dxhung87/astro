Everyone wants your advice, lots of people need favors, and those in authority have new tasks for you. Stay calm and don't react by getting short with people. Play triage officer and help those in the most need first. Warn the others you might not get to them. This way you won't make yourself crazy.

You are already acquainted on a platonic basis, but both know there is a lot more that can be explored.

I recommend you bring that tendency poolside! Swimming is an exercise that benefits the body and mind, and it is not an expensive sport. Whether you are a beginner or a High School champ, try to integrate this lovely, low-impact sport into your life. It strengthens your lung capacity while toning your whole body, and once you get on a roll it can be like meditation. Weather permitting, it's a wonderful bonus to be outside - if not, certainly your local gym has an indoor pool?","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
