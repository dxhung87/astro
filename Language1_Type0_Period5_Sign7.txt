It could involve a trip by air, perhaps across the ocean. The trip is mainly for pleasure, but it probably involves a place you've always been interested in and are anxious to see, so it's an educational trip as well. You have a lot to look forward to. Make the most of it and have fun.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018"},{"ID":"bb819d89-fd19-486b-aac9-ca7cc8de1100","MainContent":"The celestial configuration offers you the chance to get to know someone a little better - well, a lot better, actually. The truth is that it all depends on how well you can talk to each other, or how open you can be. You have the opportunity to discuss some very personal, meaningful, and deeply profound subjects, but this requires that you be honest and not frightened of discussing anything and everything.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018"},{"ID":"8401b7ef-b53e-4f9b-97a8-5a4a636c47d5","MainContent":"You will notice major shifts and changes in your workplace today. The atmosphere is likely to feel extremely different from the day before. Make decisions based on how things are now instead of on how things were.

You may feel that peace is all you need to be happy, and be heartbroken to see what is going on in the world. Try giving yourself peace as much and as often as you can: peace in the bathtub, peace at the dinner table, and peace in bed. Learn to require in your own life what you want to see in the world. Drawing that power up in yourself will give you focus and ground you. Exercise is the mainstay of this dream.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
