Practicality and common sense combine with intuition today to make you feel especially creative. A number of ideas for new projects could cross your mind, Gemini, and you'll want to write them down for later. However, there might be so many that you won't be able to decide which one to go for now. Ask your friends for their input!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 17, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"d5927b48-d1be-4695-9f49-0e7cb0719ecf","MainContent":"Love is a pleasure today, just like you always hope it is going to be, but somehow doesn't always turn out.

The very act of laughing deeply stimulates and releases pressure that has been stored in the lower chakras, where your energy tends to get blocked. Put yourself in situations where you know laughter will play a part. If you love movies, start choosing funny ones over scary ones. If you have any children in your life, get down on the floor and start playing with them. There is just no better medicine than laughter.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 17, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
