It might be just as well to take note of your feelings. If you’re frustrated or annoyed, try to purposely slow down, especially if you’re handling machinery or driving. However, your wellness sector isn’t in focus this month, so you may find that things go along much as usual. Still, there is an emphasis on recharging your batteries and doing all you can to nurture yourself and refuel.
