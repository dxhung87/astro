You won't need to make any decisions to have a great time, except maybe what to wear. You might want to politely decline a few invitations. The new moon on the sixteenth could make it hard to decide what would be the most fun and fulfilling to do. Jump in at your first impulse and don't look back. On January 31, the second full moon (and a lunar eclipse) gives you time to reflect on those things that matter most to you. You'll see ways to become more efficient and empathetic. <br><br> Standout days: 4, 10, 31<br> Challenging days: 24, 27\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":2,"Sign":6,"PeriodTitle":"January 2018"},{"ID":"7d043235-b14e-405b-90e5-1523497fd73b","MainContent":"An airy Gemini full moon on December 3 brings a restless yet optimistic start to your month. Maybe your love life isn’t what you want it to be right now, but it could be soon. Get ready for the practical punch of diligent Saturn jumping into hard-working Capricorn on the nineteenth, because this will allow you to focus on some of your most difficult romantic issues. When you put your mind to it, there’s very little you can’t accomplish in the name of love. A low-key Mars-Neptune trine on December 28 can produce some touching moments, but you have to be willing to surrender to it mind, body, and soul.
