The world will turn with you for a day, so feel free to tune out for a while. Remember that whatever path you decide to take is the right path. Regret is a useless emotion - don't even bother with it. Enjoy the present day and all the small joys that it has to offer. Communicate your dreams and bring things into balance.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"},{"ID":"32c449a3-6d79-4381-ab6c-f8e7f2f7f05c","MainContent":"The current astral aspect could turn somebody's words into a very tantalizing proposition. Somehow they just might, just could be believable, although on any other day this would be stretching it a little bit - you would know immediately that something was not quite right. But today you are happy and possibly even desperate to swallow them hook, line, and sinker.\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"},{"ID":"86040196-5ed1-4082-afae-9654713df3e6","MainContent":"Take careful notes today. If you are in a meeting with your boss and/or fellow co-workers, don't be afraid to pull out a pad of paper and a pen. Be attentive. Many details will be discussed that you won't want to forget.

Try aiming to be satisfied with your own body. This could take work in many areas of your life, not just diet and exercise. But acceptance of your own body is a lifelong issue, and you will serve yourself well if you can open up to what you truly feel about it. The day's planetary aspect will help you see the truth beneath the protective shell of denial.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
