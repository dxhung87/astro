You are practicing keeping your health boundaries this month. Health is largely dependent on sleep (observe the midnight hour) and a regular, healthy diet. Try to guard your sleep the way you would the fountain of youth - they may as well be the same thing! Your sleep affects your attitude, and they say attitude is everything.
