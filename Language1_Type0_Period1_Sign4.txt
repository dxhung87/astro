As much as you want to produce something fantastic right this minute, you will find that mere mortals such as us need the help of a creative muse. And alas, the muse is a fickle being. You can't just snap your finger and summon it. You must coax it out, slowly, gently. This all takes time, but the end result makes the effort worthwhile. For now, you must sit and wait, and trust that it will come to you.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 2, 2018"},{"ID":"32c449a3-6d79-4381-ab6c-f8e7f2f7f05c","MainContent":"Today's planetary energy brings the need to talk with a loved one, but the only question is, just how much of this talk reflects what either of you truly feels?

Sometimes it's even necessary to curb the tendency to try too many new things! For instance, if you are going to try a new food, be sure you also prepare (or order) something you know you will like that is also nutritious. Taking care of your own diet is like managing the diet of a child: you must be responsible and loving.
