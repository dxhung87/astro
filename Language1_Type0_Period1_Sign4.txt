This is admirable in the short run, but not so wise in the long run. You do no one any good if you burn out from sheer exhaustion. You must learn how to pace yourself and balance your life in such a way that there is ample time for work, play, and meditation.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 3, 2018"},{"ID":"32c449a3-6d79-4381-ab6c-f8e7f2f7f05c","MainContent":"If partners seem agitated, it could be due to the celestial energies at play. There may be a degree of conflict between you that can only be eased by coming to some sort of compromise. The problem is that neither of you will really want to do so.

Your sense of humor is likely to be downright dormant. Perhaps your expansive nature has gone inward, and you feel the need to reflect on the times gone by and the times on the road ahead. There is much to be gained by going inward.
