Perhaps the most important is sobering Saturn. Over the next couple of years or so, you’ll become more serious about making money and using your resources wisely. You could also decide to pare back on unnecessary expenses. However, with the sun and lovely Venus also moving in, this can be an excellent time to look for some last-minute bargains.","Type":1,"Period":3,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 18, 2017-Dec 24, 2017"},{"ID":"9e2631d5-e910-4217-a622-12cf48adc33b","MainContent":"What’s your gut reaction to a current romantic situation? Do you feel like you’re in over your head and can’t find a way out? You don’t need a concrete reason to say no. If something feels wrong, find the nearest exit.
