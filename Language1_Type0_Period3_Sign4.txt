You’ll enjoy being with family and close friends as 2018 gets underway. Your thoughts could also linger on opportunities to get away from your everyday routine and perhaps enjoy a short break or longer vacation. If you have the chance, go for it. At the same time, a connection between fiery Mars and lucky Jupiter could coincide with a fortunate encounter.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":3,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018-Jan 7, 2018"},{"ID":"1d2a3d41-0019-4487-a046-65e53d7c827f","MainContent":"Do you have an emotional block that’s keeping you from moving on with someone new? If you didn’t get closure on a past relationship, work on doing that in the first part of the week. It might be painful, but ignoring it hasn’t helped. You can count on a date to show up on time over the weekend, which is a nice change of pace. See? This is what it’s like with someone who isn’t flaky!","Type":2,"Period":3,"Sign":4,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 1, 2018-Jan 7, 2018"},{"ID":"502e9927-cdde-463a-85f0-f1dd042f26d6","MainContent":"A serious approach is best.
