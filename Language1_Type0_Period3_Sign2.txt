You could find you’re almost propelled along a new path by events or the encouragement of another. In fact, your friends and loved ones can be instrumental in pushing you forward into new adventures. However, as lovely Venus aligns with fervent Pluto, don’t try to push events before they’re ready to happen. Allow things to flow naturally.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":3,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018-Jan 14, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"59713d45-c87e-4d43-bd3a-29a6356b7b58","MainContent":"You’re a bit bored at the start of the week, but that doesn’t mean you should jump into a relationship. It’s tempting to hang out with someone even if they aren’t “the one,” but your time is better spent on your own or with friends. You play it safe with money over the weekend, so no splurging for you. Besides, if a date is overly impressed by a big bank account, they’re probably not a good fit.\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":3,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018-Jan 14, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"282bca69-079b-43d8-bf38-7fb14b5a4531","MainContent":"Any unspoken fears can be difficult to overcome now. You may want to feel closer to co-workers you see every day. At the same time, you may do best working alone or at least independently most of the time. Getting more sleep and less stress at home makes it easier to cope at work. Greet irritating people with your usual charm. This is an ideal time for team meetings or making any sort of artistic or creative presentation.\n\n</p>","Type":3,"Period":3,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018-Jan 14, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"d9ac742d-50f3-4faa-bbec-49d10e1f68cf","MainContent":"Tension seems to be your number one problem, not only this week but for the foreseeable future.
