If you sit for hours each day, take time out of your busy schedule to move, even if it’s just taking a brisk walk at lunch. Gentle stretching exercises can keep you limber. Don’t just leap out of bed like a firefighter responding to an alarm. You’re a highly spiritual person who tends to disconnect from the physical realm. Resist this temptation. Feeding your body nourishing foods, going outdoors, and getting enough rest will help you make the most of this month’s grounding energy. </p>","Type":10,"Period":2,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"February 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
