By all means do this. However, bear in mind that your empathic abilities are operating at a very high level today, and therefore you could actually experience some of their discomfort. Be sure to protect yourself psychically by keeping the white light around you if you want to avoid feeling ill yourself.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 5, 2018"},{"ID":"3157aca5-594d-487c-b82c-a115ddb0ee7f","MainContent":"The current planetary alignment creates a sense of conflict about whether to end a relationship.
