Physical activity of any sort will calm you down considerably. Even a quick walk around the block will be of benefit. A calmer disposition in the afternoon makes it easier for you to handle favors and requests with your customary grace. If you need to, you can \"disappear\" for a few hours early in the afternoon and take in a movie.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3157aca5-594d-487c-b82c-a115ddb0ee7f","MainContent":"Although it may seem that your dearest loved one is ignoring you, rest assured that this is not intentional.

However, it would be helpful to know what you require in terms of diet and exercise. Routine is the best way to conquer laziness and fear: don't leave it up to the last minute to decide what's for dinner or what your daily activity will be!
