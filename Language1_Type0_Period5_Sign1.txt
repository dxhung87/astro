Your friend is having some very draining hassles with family and on the job and won't be in the best of moods. If the two of you get together, you might find your partner in a surly and uncommunicative mood, and you might be the recipient of some unkind words. Either be prepared to deal with it or do something else tonight.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 13, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"f14392d1-46e5-4653-8747-6e9e0eeb65ce","MainContent":"The energy radiating from the day's aspect encourages you to initiate a date with someone special. But don't expect the evening be all starlight and cuddles, as there is too much of a down to earth influence around. You may find yourselves bogged down in conversation about subjects that are mundane.
