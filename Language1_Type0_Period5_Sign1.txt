These feelings are sent to you not to worry you or cause upset but to give clues as to how to deal with the possibilities. You may also have to deal with your own self-doubt. Dig in, do what you can, and assure a positive outcome. Remember, it's possible to spin straw into gold!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"f14392d1-46e5-4653-8747-6e9e0eeb65ce","MainContent":"The planets are making loving relationships a slightly chillier option than usual today. Somehow a loved one just isn't in the mood for all that kissing and cuddling, and all the other activities you normally get up to. It may be best to make yourself really cozy and spend some time by yourself, and then arrange to meet up again in a few days. Don't worry about a thing.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3db8e336-7264-4c0a-9b24-837441756948","MainContent":"Take the initiative to start a new routine for yourself in the workplace today. Don't be afraid to bite off more than you think you can chew. You will handle every new task just beautifully. Don't doubt yourself.

Being rushed by others is also not something you will react well to. One of the best ways to escape the expectations of others is to set your limits and stick to them like crazy. Give yourself an extra hour at the gym, try some new form of a workout in addition to your regular routine. I do not mean that you should push yourself too far, but you have the extra energy today, and it's best that you use it for your own purposes, not someone else's.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
