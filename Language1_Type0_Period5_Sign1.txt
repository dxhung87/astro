Don't fall into this trap. Your friend is probably surrounded by a lot of demanding people who need assistance, and therefore isn't phoning anybody else. Be patient, distract yourself, and give your friend another call tomorrow. The response should be more immediate then!","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"85c734a2-21f1-4855-866f-9f5cf3b0ad06","MainContent":"The astral energy encourages you to forgive and forget a recent problem with a close love relationship.

The meticulous child who rearranged their sock drawer every Saturday might re-emerge as you wash up after cooking a nutritious meal; the bouncing little gymnast who had the energy of a puppy may float across your mind as you near the yoga studio. As your practice strengthens, remember to gently embrace the parts of you that emerge. It is through acceptance, not judgment, that we achieve wholeness.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
