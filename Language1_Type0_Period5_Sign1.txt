You might even spend the entire evening watching whatever happens to be on TV. It would be far more productive if you treated yourself to a trip to the bookstore and picked up some new reading material. At least you'll learn something while your partner is away!\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"3157aca5-594d-487c-b82c-a115ddb0ee7f","MainContent":"Don't let the day end with bad feelings about someone who is particularly special to you.

If you remain open and loving toward yourself when you've made a poor choice, you will have the opportunity to learn what got you there. This is a good time to develop good diet and exercise habits. If you typically decide on your outfit a day in advance, or if you are good at planning the weekend's fun, try using the same type of planning toward the next day's diet and exercise!","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
