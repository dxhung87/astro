A friend or family member could help. Anything planted today is likely to grow and thrive, so don't worry about seeds that don't sprout. You might spend a bit too much time doing it, however. Work only until you're pleasantly tired, then quit for the day; otherwise, you might burn yourself out.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 22, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"The astral alignment encourages you to focus less on your duties and responsibilities, and more on getting out and enjoying yourself. Don't feel that by accepting that invitation to dinner you are lacking in discipline. You need this break and time to relax in the company of someone you really like being with. Give yourself some space to free up. You can get back to work tomorrow.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 22, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"85d65276-3314-41e5-b8be-8b2d02daa2cf","MainContent":"Your mind is likely to deceive you today. An idea that you think is too good to be true probably is. Someone else may try to talk you into a new deal or project. Don't be too quick to commit. Doing so will throw you off balance in more ways than one.","Type":3,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 22, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"08005fea-d55f-4624-b591-29735d149452","MainContent":"Your are a natural nurturer, and no matter how much we tell you to nurture yourself you will always have a need to nurture  others. Try to combine the two wherever possible. In fact, the planetary energy at play gives you increased perception, and you are intuitively able to sense your boundaries. You may find you wake up early in the morning during the current transit. It's a great time to take a walk and give yourself some personal time - and the dog might love it, too!","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 22, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
