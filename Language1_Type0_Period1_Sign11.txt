People may be a bit stingy with everything from money to emotions to time spent with loved ones. The more you tell someone else that they're wrong, the more that person is going to reject your advice. In general, this is a good time to simply stay out of other people's way.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 24, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"The energy radiating from the planets could make you determined to encourage someone close to you to see your point of view.

This is a time for nurturing yourself, not others. Give yourself what you need in terms of diet, exercise and rest.
