You could find yourself making a lot of phone calls in this regard, which could keep you busy for much of the day. Your level of excitement is likely to be very high, which makes it important that you remember to take breaks, catch your breath, and definitely get a little exercise.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"You may find yourself attracted by all that is different, unique, and original in a person today.

If you have an Aquarian friend or acquaintance, it might be a good idea to approach them. They will likely understand where you are coming from, and provide you with some inspiration. Remember to offer what you are asking for.
