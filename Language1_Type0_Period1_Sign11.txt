You could even decide to get away from them and go hide out just for the day, for example, in a movie theater watching an afternoon film. But you won't find the movie you want to see. Don't try and run away from the gravity of the moment; you may become even more serious than the people you are running away from.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 19, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"The current planetary aspect may encourage you to be even more serious than usual. If you and a loved one are considering making an even deeper commitment to each other and strengthening the bond, then you will both want to think about this and discuss the implications of doing so.

Dreams can hold precious information for waking life. The habit of writing down your dreams actually makes it easier to remember them. There are no ratings determining what can \"air\" and what can't in your dreams, so you can take them as seriously as you would the artwork you made as a child. Respecting your dreams teaches you self-awareness and sharpens your understanding of what really matters to you.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 19, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
