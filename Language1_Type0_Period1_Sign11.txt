You probably aren't feeling up to it. This might be a bit irritating, and somewhat embarrassing as well. However, you just might have needed the rest even if you hadn't eaten too much. Make the most of your evening alone. Soak in a tub and go to bed early. In the morning, you'll be glad you did.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"1acb558d-af13-4b10-a94c-5e6f8b13edfa","MainContent":"Don't hide yourself away under a mountain of work, as this will not really help matters. The current planetary configuration encourages you to get out and to face up to someone about whom you may have been having one or two misgivings. Rather than make matters worse, this can only improve the situation, and will ultimately create a much deeper and stronger bond between you.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"db043b4e-ad5a-4ca8-be09-3af9b6b77b3d","MainContent":"An argument may arise today between you and a coworker, boss, or client.

Be careful -this can be dangerous. There is no certainty that our health tomorrow will be the same as today; we must always maintain a humble attitude and serve our bodies each day. That natural human laziness can be overcome with a tiny bit of discipline. Avoid taking care of others in place of yourself. If you liver according to this maxim, you will ultimately be a better friend, as you will be available and strong in times of crisis and need.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
