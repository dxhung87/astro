You're likely to come up with a plan that is more than workable since your thinking is especially clear and logical right now. Others might be inspired to join you. Whatever work you do should be accomplished quickly and skillfully. Use your energy to get as much done as possible.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 17, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"The astral influence certainly gets you off your backside today and moving in the direction of doing something positive about that so called \"romantic\" relationship of yours. With the grace of a chimpanzee you swing into action, carefully negotiating a deal that suits you both, and at the same time making sure that you get exactly what you know is your right.

This is not something you can put off for the future (when you're not in this relationship, when your kids are grown, when your job is not so demanding). It's the #1 priority now. A good test is to notice how much water you drink in a day. If you can safely say that you drink over ten glasses of water a day, I'm off your case!","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 17, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
