You could be forced to confront difficulties in your current situation. You might decide to call in a few favors from people you haven't heard from in ages. Old debts may need repaying. This is a great time to tie up loose ends, attain closure, and move on.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 23, 2017"},{"ID":"1acb558d-af13-4b10-a94c-5e6f8b13edfa","MainContent":"The planetary energy brings a feeling of peace after troubled times, of calm after the storm.
