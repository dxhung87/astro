Your intuition seems to be temporarily blocked, so you can't figure it out for yourself. Don't try; it's probably buried too deeply within the other person. Make it clear that you're there if needed and then allow this person to go his or her own way. Don't let this situation cause you to doubt their need and respect for you.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"Best not to even think about going out on that date tonight. If there is any way you can put it off for a few days, then do so. For some cosmic reason the evening just won't take off, so it may be best to go off and do something else by yourself, or have a break. It is going to work eventually; you won't have lost out.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"85d65276-3314-41e5-b8be-8b2d02daa2cf","MainContent":"Your attitude at the beginning of the day will determine how others treat you throughout the rest of the day.

Unless you are a paid professional during office hours, taking care of yourself first is your foremost responsibility. Even parents need to focus on themselves if they are going to be proper role models for their children. If you need someone to nurture, look in the mirror! You are a wonderful listener: ask your reflection what it needs, and hop to it! It may take a little practice, but you can do it.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 16, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
