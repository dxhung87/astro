Some uncomfortable feelings you've had about events in the news could prove to be accurate, which might be a bit disconcerting. Remember that there is so much in the Universe that can't be explained through logic or science!","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":11,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 23, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"aa26d147-2bec-4776-9b5c-16c4ed7d0523","MainContent":"If you have been looking for someone special, then you may be surprised at what transpires at work today.

The best thing you can do is to stick to what you know. You know, for example, that eight glasses of water is the daily dietary minimum (double it if you wish). You also know that personal time is important to you (even though you tend to pretend it is not).
