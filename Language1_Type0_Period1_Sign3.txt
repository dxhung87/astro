When things repeatedly don't go the way you want, or bad things happen to you, it can be very easy to fall into a victim mentality. Yet while we canâ€™t always control what happens around and to us, we always have the choice as to how we're going to handle it. Grieving can be a critical element to healing, but there's a fine line. Choose to keep going and insist on being better to yourself.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"ea43b658-be5b-49c5-afe2-f4f1df0121f2","MainContent":"The astral energy encourages you to socialize and get out to any meetings or parties that you have been invited to.

The things that you mean to do for your health but keep putting off - drinking more water, eating less sugar, exercising more often - these are things that only you can make happen. When you find yourself going to others for comfort, ask yourself whether you could be the one providing yourself with comfort in the form of healthy habits.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 7, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
