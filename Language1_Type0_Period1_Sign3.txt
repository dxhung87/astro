Mind and emotions join together in a beneficial partnership, enabling you to increase your understanding of those close to you. Romantic involvements strengthen in particular, as an understanding of your partner's values, attitudes, and motivations becomes clearer to you.

The subtle, mounting stress of your life style, the diversions from regular diet and upset in sleep schedule are things we all experience. You tend to be particularly affected.
