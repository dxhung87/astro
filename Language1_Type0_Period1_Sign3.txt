You may feel like some sort of inventor who has wild ideas that could help to revolutionize the future. Bring these ideas into the open and see what kind of response you get from the people around you. Cutting-edge concepts are likely to appeal to you the most. These are the ones that you should pursue and follow through on if you can.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"ea43b658-be5b-49c5-afe2-f4f1df0121f2","MainContent":"You may be a little confused about the difference between what you think and what you feel. Because of the day's significant planetary aspect, the two may become irreparably entwined, and you may not be making your normal good sense.

Unless of course, you reach your breaking point and then bust a move. You work this way much of the time. You hunker down and fester over something, and then one day for no apparent reason you change your tune. It's hard to always know whether you're festering in a productive way or not. To help cover your bases, keep a rigorous physical regimen going on during these times of confusion. This you don't have to think about: just do it.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
