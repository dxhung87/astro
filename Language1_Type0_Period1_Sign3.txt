You and your romantic partner may leave a gathering of friends to be alone together and talk. You communicate well, and the intense feelings between you could be obvious to both of you, and embarrassingly, to everyone who knows you. If you've been together for a while, talk of commitment or a wedding could come up. Enjoy your day.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 30, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"ea43b658-be5b-49c5-afe2-f4f1df0121f2","MainContent":"Love and romance are more associated with a sense of security, and also with ideas of what each of you can do for each other. The celestial alignment is highlighting this aspect of the relationship, and making you aware of how much you have given and what you have received in return - and also whether this is actually enough for you. Discussions will be fairly amicable, though.","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 30, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"62d28939-6af3-4ec9-9dc3-f502fca1dd4c","MainContent":"You may get quite frustrated with others, since everyone else seems to be taking themselves too seriously today.

Give yourself the luxury of a personal trainer if you can afford it, and you feel you would benefit from that extra guidance. Otherwise, develop a workout schedule with a friend so that you are not alone on this very important venture. Your exercise regimen is only valuable if you do it consistently. Make it easy for yourself.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 30, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
