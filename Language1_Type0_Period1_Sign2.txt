In this age of computers, the keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides much more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of the rhythmic motion of writing with a pen is far more soothing and even healing than most realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good and unlock places within you that aren't accessed by typing.

This is a form of paralysis, and should be dealt with accordingly. You have nothing to gain from keeping your health on hold due to some unresolved feelings. If you can't bring yourself to stop eating sweets, that's no reason to put off going to the gym!
