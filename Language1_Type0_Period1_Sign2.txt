Sometimes passionately out of the blue, and at other times quietly and sweetly. The alignment of the planets suggests that you cannot force a particular relationship into being unless the other person really feels ready for it. You can keep phoning or writing, but unless they want to respond of their own free will, there is not a lot you can do.
