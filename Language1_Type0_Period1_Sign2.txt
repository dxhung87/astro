Today you could feel like putting your friendships in some kind of order and getting a bit of perspective on things. It's time to figure which of your friends are really there for you when you need them, which of them show you how much they care about you, and which ones do not. Each kind of friendship can be useful to you in its own way. Don't be afraid to admit this.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 20, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"225550a3-8a03-4ce0-90cb-992982589a68","MainContent":"Part of you does and part of you doesn't.

Whom you hang out with, what you have for dinner, when you go to bed - these desires are made clearer at this time. On the other hand, be on the lookout that certain areas of your life don't fluctuate with your changing moods. You should try to exercise at least three times a week.
