Give some careful thought to the next couple of months, Taurus. So many ideas may come your way that it might not be feasible to try to use them all.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 18, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"225550a3-8a03-4ce0-90cb-992982589a68","MainContent":"The energy from the planets creates a mood of harmony between you and your love interest.
