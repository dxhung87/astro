This is an unbeatable combination, and is especially strengthened with the current astral energy. Be sure to go the extra mile today, even if you aren't in the mood to do so. Someone in a position of power and authority may ask you to join him or her for dinner, or perhaps you'll be invited to \"perform\" at a party. These are ideal opportunities to showcase your talents, so embrace them rather than shy away from them.","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 3, 2018"},{"ID":"3d2cdef4-ec4b-44a8-97f2-0b9304275b5d","MainContent":"Romance and relationships may not click quite so easily right now. Your love interest or love interest may be in a particularly persnickety mood, and less than willing to agree to your suggestions. You may have some energetic conversations about how things ought to be, but as far as anything else is concerned, there may not be much chance for progress today. It's best to just be honest and say how you really feel.\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":1,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 3, 2018"},{"ID":"47da11dd-b8a1-404d-8ef2-f93cfbe96a87","MainContent":"Wild accusations will spread around the workplace, and many of them will not be so nice.

Especially for a sign which tends to get bogged down by the inequalities of everyday life. Try thinking of exercise as something the body deserves. When your mind wants to talk you out of it or wants to convince you that procrastination is OK, remember that the body can be ignored by the mind (up to a point) and you must be the champion of the silent and oppressed! It's only fair.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 3, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
