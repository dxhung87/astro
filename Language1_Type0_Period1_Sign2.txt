Try to keep a lid on hasty comments fueled by intense emotions. These comments may come out the wrong way and be used against you later. Bring your cheerful disposition to the group and leave your stubborn attitude at home.

Yes, only strength and determination will conquer doom and gloom. I would recommend making exercise a priority, but it's OK to go light. If there's something you can do that is more fun than your regular routine- a game of tennis rather than a trip to the gym- it would be a good move.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 25, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
