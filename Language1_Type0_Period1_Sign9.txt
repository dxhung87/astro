That's all right, but you may want to take a look at your financial situation even if that's not really your thing. You tend to resent having to deal with these lowly material questions, but if you don't, you could severely restrict your freedom to live life to its fullest.

We must open up to a new way of living with others. Take this period of change seriously, and you will not be left behind.
