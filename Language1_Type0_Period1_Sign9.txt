This is, therefore, only a temporary situation, and your accounts should be back to normal in time, although some caution with regard to spending may need to be observed for a while. Work creatively on your budget and try to relax.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 8, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"5fe484bd-5b13-4cfc-ac28-f2b78e9bf2ab","MainContent":"You can play all kinds of games and drag red herrings all over the place in order to try and fool someone about your feelings.

Try to plan ahead: shop for dinner early and know what you want to prepare. Make yourself healthy renditions of your favorite \"comfort\" foods you loved as a child. Give into the urge to rest and nurture yourself, but in a healthy and conscious way. If you invite a friend to join you for dinner, ask them to take a walk with you afterward.
