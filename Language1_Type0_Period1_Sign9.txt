All this intensity is interesting, to be sure, but also more time consuming than you'd like. You barely have time to handle your own affairs, much less those of others. If you begin to feel yourself at the bursting point, call your own personal time-out. A shower or bath would do you a world of good, Sagittarius.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"5fe484bd-5b13-4cfc-ac28-f2b78e9bf2ab","MainContent":"It is no good trying to force a certain argument to go your way, even if you are in the right, and you just know that it would solve all your current problems.

Try to vary your behavior and still be conscious of the needs of the body. Consider forms of exercise that you have never participated in: consider why this is - are there body issues that keep you from possibly enjoying certain forms of exercise? Today's aspect assists you in probing these depths. Try tapping into memories of early childhood experiences on the playground.","Type":5,"Period":1,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
