A sensitive issue is apt to be pulling on you in such a way that it's leaving you feeling like you are way out in left field in terms of the way you relate to others. You might want to consider letting someone else take the lead for once and allow stability to form before the next decision is made.\n\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":1,"Sign":9,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 30, 2017"},{"ID":"5fe484bd-5b13-4cfc-ac28-f2b78e9bf2ab","MainContent":"In order to get the attention of the person of your dreams, you may have to keep on talking and talking.

This is natural in the beginning, and can be either encouraging or discouraging. The goal is really to focus on yourself, and refrain from comparison or judgment. Just take yourself and your goals seriously! If it helps, write down your intentions for the day and check them off at night.
