Instead of driving yourself hard, you can adopt a more deliberate approach to life. Taking a class that has nothing to do with your career aspirations is strongly advised. Seven represents spiritual fulfillment rather than material desire. Learning how to bake cakes, make clothes, or build furniture can help you discover hidden aspects of yourself. Powerful realizations can occur while youâ€™re mixing dough, stitching a hem, or sanding wood. When restlessness threatens to consume you, pour your energy into repetitive tasks that allow spiritual epiphanies to occur. </p>","Type":10,"Period":2,"Sign":3,"PeriodTitle":"December 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
