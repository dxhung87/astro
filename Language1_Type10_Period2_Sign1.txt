That’s because it’s ruled by the number five, which represents intellectual freedom. Put aside your cares and adopt an experimental approach to life. Take up a hobby that has always interested you. Expect to be laughably bad at first. Treat every error as a learning opportunity. Allow others to be better than you. Ask accomplished rivals for advice. This open-minded attitude will allow you to relax and have fun. Instead of beating yourself up for being less than the best, you’ll enjoy being a beginner. When you adopt a more forgiving attitude toward yourself, delightful surprises will occur. </p>","Type":10,"Period":2,"Sign":1,"PeriodTitle":"December 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
