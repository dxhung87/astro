Now that it's here, you probably aren't going to want to be partying a lot on this 7-Day. Quiet contemplation, spiritual awareness, and introspection are activities that are far better suited to this day, especially given that you are a Seven. Even if you have family obligations, consider taking a walk by yourself after lunch. Use some time this evening for deeper reflection. Get in touch with yourself. Be sure to let others know that you need a little of this quiet time if you find yourself interrupted too much.</p>","Type":10,"Period":1,"Sign":7,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 25, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
