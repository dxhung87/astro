It seems that this is the only way to free yourself from the mountain of professional and social obligations that are piling up. How can you ever hope to attend all of them, or even half? Have you considered that you may not need to? Send someone else in your stead, perhaps, or simply respond that you can't make it. You wouldn't be the first to say no. You are entitled to some downtime.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 4, 2018"},{"ID":"76bc6fa1-a202-4631-8a98-adf571efb5e6","MainContent":"Romance could be a little like a roller-coaster ride right now. Feelings will be running high, and there is a higher chance of thinking or suspecting the worst and of noticing the less savory aspects of your sweetheart's behavior. It might help if you spend some time in conversation, being honest with each other. If this doesn't work, perhaps give each other some space.","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 4, 2018"},{"ID":"edcfd49f-f43c-427d-85b0-8052227ee7ba","MainContent":"Don't overstep your boundaries today. To insure that you don't, take the time to set things straight with a co-worker and/or employer. Make sure everyone is clear with what the expectations are. Doing so will help prevent a nasty confrontation.\n\n</p>","Type":3,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 4, 2018"},{"ID":"c7b56e74-9827-4338-b41a-6223d37a7c1e","MainContent":"There could be some rejection from within to \"doing the right thing.\" It is important to understand this resistance and to take measures to handle it. For instance, if you feel that eating only rich foods will satisfy you today - try choosing a salad that has rich ingredients. Or, if exercise is not on your program, elect to walk home from work. As you make these small compromises, you will have given your \"evil twin\" some feedback, and a heated discussion is likely to ensue!","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 4, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
