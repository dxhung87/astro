It is not an especially passionate time, although there could be a lot of flirting and meaningful eye contact.

There is some panic that often occurs, a feeling of urgency and a sense of responsibility to make everything OK. Give yourself the benefit of the doubt and develop a systematic way of dealing with this feeling. Deep breathing exercises, which are taught in most yoga classes, along with drinking a few glasses of water, are the best ways to calm the body and the mind.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 6, 2018"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
