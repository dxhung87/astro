Stop pulling out old photo albums and crying about past experiences. You will only succeed in sinking into a puddle of tears that you can't pull yourself out of. Instead, this is a day to look to the future and plan for new experiences that you can enjoy with the people you love.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 27, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"14440dd6-8d2d-44a5-a2d7-6d1c0614ff24","MainContent":"The day's significant planetary aspect makes you certain of one thing, and that is that you are not sure what is going on between you and your love interest.

Likewise, you won't be caught on some trendy diet for too long - you're too interested in working towards a balanced lifestyle that involves healthy practices that nobody's last name belongs on.
