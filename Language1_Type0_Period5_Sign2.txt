You may go to extremes on this level, so be careful how you wield your power. The key is not to get too attached to your ideas and any results that you want. Things will happen as they need to happen.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 21, 2017"},{"ID":"76bc6fa1-a202-4631-8a98-adf571efb5e6","MainContent":"This may not prove to be the most sociable day you have experienced this year. The planetary energy makes meeting up with others, and that essential flow of conversation, more than a little awkward. People seem to stumble over their words, blush, get over-embarrassed, and generally lack confidence. Not the best time for that first date. Wait a while, and it could be the best thing ever!\n\n</p>","Type":2,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 21, 2017"},{"ID":"edcfd49f-f43c-427d-85b0-8052227ee7ba","MainContent":"The project you are currently working on has taken a bend that you did not anticipate.

Swimming would be recommended now, in order to feel your own weightlessness while you exercise out those frustrations.\n\n</p>","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Dec 21, 2017"}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
