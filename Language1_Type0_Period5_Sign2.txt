Just hang in there and you'll still have a great evening.\r\n\r\n</p>","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 10, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"b18ce53f-e6c0-405b-bf14-d7d3658299cc","MainContent":"The astral energy encourages you to try and understand a certain person a little better. You may actually begin to question your motives as to why you are in a relationship with them in the first place.
