You're getting so wrapped up in other people's dramas that you're feeling drained when it comes to your own concerns. Calm down and relax physically and mentally. Getting too stressed about a certain issue isn't healthy. You may end up foiling the situation much more than if you left it alone.

But hold your horses, you can't go up to someone you have had your eye on, and just blurt it all out at once.

It is important to choose the food and the kind of exercise that is right for you. As an individual that depends on balance, you might do well learning some meditation practice - no matter how big or how small the practice, it will aid you tremendously. Some aspects of yoga involve meditation, and you can find classes at your local fitness club.
