It's an excellent time to make a list of things that youâ€™ve either put off or haven't been able to settle on. This doesn't need to be things that are just related to work or finances. Consider putting effort into your personal life as well. If there are issues surrounding friends, your romantic partner, or family, this is a great opportunity to think up options.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"14440dd6-8d2d-44a5-a2d7-6d1c0614ff24","MainContent":"You will feel more inclined to let someone special know how you feel about them today.

Check the dates and if they are old, into the garbage they go (in sealed plastic bags, preferably, to protect animals and young children). While you're there, check out how much \"fun stuff\" you have in your cabinet. Are there enough essential oils and bath salts? Enough bubbles to get you through stressful times? Consider adding Lemon Verbena to your collection of essential oils.","Type":5,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Feb 9, 2018","YoutubeURL":null}],"IsSuccess":true,"Exception":null,"Log":null}
