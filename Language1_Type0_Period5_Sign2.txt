Just because we can't perceive something with our eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or fingers doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Pay respect to the force field that surrounds us, and to the animate and inanimate forms that exist in our everyday life. You are apt to perceive life as if it were a prayer today.","Type":1,"Period":5,"Sign":2,"PeriodTitle":"Jan 29, 2018","YoutubeURL":null},{"ID":"14440dd6-8d2d-44a5-a2d7-6d1c0614ff24","MainContent":"The vibration from the planets makes you very prone to believing anything and everything today.

Think of it this way: when you see someone not doing their best, it resonates with something inside yourself that you wish you were doing better. Always try to find that thing inside yourself that you are reminded of before you leap to help someone else.
